## About Myself
My name is Marina. I am 23 years old. I live in Minsk. In 2020, she graduated from the Faculty of Physics and Engineering with a degree in computer science and mathematics. After graduation, she worked in her profession. The experience of work and study convinced me that this sphere is very far for me. Therefore, when I saw a recruitment for a front-end developer course, I decided to try myself in this area. I think that this is where I can work with pleasure. This is exactly what has always fascinated me.
